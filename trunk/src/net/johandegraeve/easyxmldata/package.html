Offers an Interface, Utilites and a Parser which allows an easy XML Parser implementation for custom
XML elements and corresponding java classes.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

You want to parse an XML document and create corresponding classes that will hold the XML parsed XML 
elements. This package allows you to create your own classes that will represent the XML elements. For
each possible tag that can be foud in the XML document, you need to define a custom class with the same name. Each class needs to implement the interface {@link net.johandegraeve.easyxmldata.XMLElement}<br>
<br>
The methods in the interface {@link net.johandegraeve.easyxmldata.XMLElement} allow the custom class to define 
what needs to happen with
<ul>
  <li>the attributes that are found. The method will be called even if the list of attributes is empty.
  It allows the custom class to populate internal fields with the values of the attributes in the XML document,
  or to generate a {@link org.xml.sax.SAXException} in case attributes are missing.</li>
  <li>child elements that are found : the custom class decides which children are allowed. Some may not be allowed in
  which case the custom class can throw a {@link org.xml.sax.SAXException}.</li>
  <li>text that is found. Two methods are called that contain the text, a trimmed version and an untrimmed version.</li>
</ul>
The methods also allow to
<ul>
  <li>check if an element is complete : this method is called when the end-tag of the element in the XML document
  is encountered. At that moment the custom class may check whether all mandatory fields are received
  and if not throw a {@link org.xml.sax.SAXException}.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The package defines a {@link net.johandegraeve.easyxmldata.EasyXMLDataParser} class. This is where {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler} is extended.
The class overrides {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler}'s methods {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler#characters(char[] ch, int start, int length)},
{@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler#endDocument}, {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler#endElement}, 
{@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler#setDocumentLocator}, {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler#startDocument},
{@link org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler#startElement}
and this is where the methods defined in {@link net.johandegraeve.easyxmldata.XMLElement} are called for an instance of a class
with the same name as the tag found in the XML Document (optionally packagename followed by a prefix).<br>
<br>
A trick is implemented to allow to define the classes corresponding to the XML elements, with a bit more clear names than just the name of the tag in smaller case.
<br>
The trick is that a prefix can be added before the name of the Element in the class name. When creating a {@link net.johandegraeve.easyxmldata.EasyXMLDataParser#EasyXMLDataParser(String[], String[])},
then a list of package names and prefix names needs to be supplied. Whenever a tag is encountered in a parsed XML document, the parser will search for a class in each package supplied, but the class
name will be prefixed with the corresponding prefix in the supplied array.<br>
When validating a received XML Element in {@link net.johandegraeve.easyxmldata.XMLElement#addChild(XMLElement)}, and if you want to validate the type of XML element received, then
it is important to know that the class of the XMLElement will be prefix+XML element name.

<br><br>
The {@link net.johandegraeve.easyxmldata.Utilities} class defines some useful static methods.
